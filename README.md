# PPGA

## Parallel Processing for Genetic Algorithms

PPGA is a modular, Python based module for
build and optimize genetic algorithms using
the `multiprocessing` module.

The parallel model is designed to optimize the
**crossover**, **mutation** and **evaluation**
steps through a simple **map reduce** paradigm.
